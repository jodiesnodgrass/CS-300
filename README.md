In CS 300 we worked to develop c++ code with algorithmic designs. The class mostly worked with a gradual milestones to the newly created project two which was based on recommendation from project one. I had chosen vector as the ideal choice so my project two is vector based. 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

All the milestones led up to the final project creating a code being able to read, store, sort, and print course information. For project 1 I had calculated run times between vector, hash table, and binary search tree and disscussed the pros and cons of each. Having chosen vector would be best for the project I created a vector code for the course files. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Even though vector seemed to be the slowest data type it has other pros that I believed would be best for the project. I considered it to be best as it could easily keep sorted data. While the hash table data type seemed to be a close second to vector it would not be able to keep sorted data. It is important to look over the pros and cons of ech data structure as every project is different and requires different necessities. If sorted data was not needed I would have most likely chosen the hash table structure.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

In CS 300 I came across quite a few errors some simple some not. For every error if I could not easily figure out what may be wrong and if I started to get disppointed I took a break. I believe taking a breather is good for mental health and may help you figure out the issues later on once less stressed. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

In this course CS 300 it was the first class I have had to create an entire code on my own. Creating the code for project two gave me confidence in my decisions. Now knowing the pros and cons of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees will help me decide what structure would be best for a project. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In these projects I learned a few things that need improvement. I now know that my pseudo code must be more readable. With more details the code could be maintained and adapted easily.
